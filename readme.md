## ThresholdCompareMorphology
Segmenting objects by threshold/compare to background and removing noise with morphology operations.
### Description
Segmentation of low contrast object using different approaches such as direct threshold, comparative threshold, gray scale morphology and pixel region morphology.
The thresholdCompare function is useful for segmenting objects in uneven illumination. An image has been taken without any object, and the threshold is given in relation to each corresponding pixel.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main' function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event. Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage. Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page. 
To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API is necessary. For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
